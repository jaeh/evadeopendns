evadeopendns
============

if you are using opendns to resolve dns, then you might be as annoyed as i am that you cannot change the default search from theirs to your favorite. to solve it i decided to write this plugin. i still want to contribute to opendns, so this plugin will load the ads in a separate window in the background, then load all ads it finds on the page with a randomized delay, then display them for randomized seconds, then close all those tabs for you.
